War and conflict remain, though it is believed that the New AI's code will help begin the process of freeing countless lives from oppression. This \
new land has changed from where it began; and almost unrecognizable. Many families have been torn apart from this war, and many lives have been \
negatively impacted due to this tension. Though, there is hope to begin again with the construction of the NEW AI. Things cannot immediately \
return to the way they once were, though in time, this nation will heal from its war wounds.

    input(""" Though with every good comes some bad. It is rumored that the AI opponents have began to formulate and plot how to destroy the New AI. \
There is talk amongst the nation that nuclear AI engineering has been tested within the labs. And though this has not been confirmed, there have been \
nuclear detonations ran by the labs in deserted, unpopulated locations. The country of Nitro-Rai cannot withstand nor survive an AI nuclear war - \
ultimately, Nitro-Rai will no longer exist. The New AI is Nitro-Rai's ace; protecting the New AI is now the priority...Because if destroyed, \
Nitro-Rai and the remaining citizens will no longer exist.""")
